# Car price prediction ðŸš˜

Embarking on **Project 3 at Oasis Infobyte Data Science Internship**, I've delved into the exciting realm of car price prediction, unleashing a powerhouse of regression algorithms. From the classics like `linear regression` to the tree-based wonders of `decision trees`, `random forests`, and `xgboost` â€“ the journey was exhilarating. However, the real star turned out to be `CatBoost`, shining bright with an impressive R-squared score of **0.97**, proving its prowess in capturing the intricacies of car pricing dynamics."
